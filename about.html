            <h1> About </h1>
            <div>
                <p> My name is Vasudev Menon and I am a 2nd year student currently pursuing a double major in Computer Science &
                    Mathematics at NC State University in Raleigh, NC. I am very much interested in pursuing my career in deep learning
                    and artificial intelligence. I have a strong foundation in both computer programming and mathematics. I have worked
                    at the IEC (Innovative Educational Computing) research laboratory at my university where I worked on testing Batch
                    Normalization, RNNs, LSTMs, and other various deep learning algorithms. I enjoy implementing my theoretical
                    knowledge into
                    practical real-world applications. One of my interesting projects was learning about Convolutional Neural Networks,
                    then training a binary classification model on a set of facial images using that deep learning architecture, which I
                    was then able to implement into a fun Python application that uses OpenCV library to determine facial emotions.I
                    worked at Harris Teeter as a customer service clerk where I worked in a fast paced environment which was entirely
                    dependent on teamwork and collaboration, which taught me the importance of effective communication and cooperation
                    in achieving the goals. </p>
                <p> Outside of school and work, I really enjoy playing the violin (both western and eastern) and making music. I
                    interned at a recording studio as an audio engineer and enjoyed working with various artists. In the future, I want
                    to own my own record label company and I want to make an impact in the entertainment industry. Looking ahead, I am
                    excited about the possibilities that exist within the field of computer science and mathematics, and I hope to be
                    part of something that fosters a culture of learning and innovation. </p>
