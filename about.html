            <h1> About </h1>
            <div>
                <p> I'm Vasudev Menon, a third-year undergraduate student at NC State University, pursuing a double
                    major in Computer Science and Mathematics. My academic interests lie at the intersection of deep
                    learning, mathematics, and software development. I have hands-on experience in machine learning
                    research, including my work at the IEC research lab, where I explored Batch Normalization, RNNs, and
                    LSTMs. My passion for applying theory to real-world challenges extends beyond research—I’ve
                    developed software solutions, contributed to large-scale data science projects, and engineered
                    AI-driven applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, music is a central part of my life. My experience as an audio engineer in a
                    recording studio deepened my appreciation for sound design and production. Looking forward, I aim to
                    merge my expertise in artificial intelligence with my love for music, whether through generative
                    audio models, music technology, or building my own record label.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm always looking for opportunities to innovate, collaborate, and push boundaries in both tech and
                    music.
                </p>
